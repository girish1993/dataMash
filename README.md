# dataMash

<hr />

dataMash is a small and quick project to showcase the various ways of handling, preprocessing, complaince checking, populating and finally parsing
fixed width field files. The project modularises each of the above operations into several classes and follows OOP concepts to implement the 
aforementioned operations. The project has been well documented and explains the purpose of each of the methods written as part of implementation.

Follow the steps to run the project on your machine.

**PreRequisites**

Python version >= 3.7


1. clone the repo on your local machine
```
    git clone https://github.com/girish1993/dataMash.git
```


2. run the project.
```
    cd app/ 
    python main.py
```

*OR*

You could run the application using by building the docker image.
```
    docker build -t myimage .
```


3. View the output files

- `data/generated_input/my_data.fwf` is the output of the generating a fixed width field file by using the `spec.json` as the input. The process has been subjected to fair bit of error handling. check the code for more details
- `data/parsed_data/my_data.csv` is the parsed csv file that is generated by using `my_data.fwf` as the input. 

NOTE: To access the file from inside the docker container. run the following set of commands

```
    docker run -i -t myimage /bin/bash
    cd data/generated_input/
    cat my_data.fwf

```

and to see the parsed csv results:

```
    cd data/generated_input/
    cat my_data.csv
```
