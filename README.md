# dataMash<hr />dataMash is a small and quick project to showcase the various ways of handling, preprocessing, complaince checking, populating and finally parsingfixed width field files. The project modularises each of the above operations into several classes and follows OOP concepts to implement the aforementioned operations. The project has been well documented and explains the purpose of each of the methods written as part of implementation.Follow the steps to run the project on your machine.**PreRequisites**Python version >= 3.71. clone the repo on your local machine```    git clone https://github.com/girish1993/dataMash.git```2. run the project.```    python main.py```3. View the output files- `my_data.fwf` is the output of the generating a fixed width field file by using the `spec.json` as the input. The process has been subjected to fair bit of error handling. check the code for more details- `my_data.csv` is the parsed csv file that is generated by using `my_data.fwf` as the input.
